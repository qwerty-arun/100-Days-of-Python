## **File Handling**

### **Easy**

* Write a program to read a text file and count the number of lines, words, and characters.
* Write a program to copy the contents of one file into another.

---

### **Medium**

* Write a program to read a CSV file containing student names and marks, and calculate average marks.
* Write a program to search for a specific word in a file and print the line numbers where it appears.

---

### **Hard**

* Implement a log system:

  * Every time your program runs, append the date, time, and a message into a `log.txt` file.

* Build a mini “Contact Book” that:

  * Saves contacts (`name, phone, email`) into a CSV file.
  * Can add, view, search, and delete contacts using file operations.

* Write a program that processes a large file (say 500MB+) **line by line** (without loading whole file into memory) and counts word frequencies.
