## **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

### **Easy**

* Create a `Rectangle` class with attributes `length` and `width`. Add methods to:

  * calculate area
  * calculate perimeter

* Write a `BankAccount` class with:

  * methods `deposit(amount)` and `withdraw(amount)`
  * attribute `balance`

---

### **Medium**

* Create a `Student` class that stores name, roll number, and marks in subjects.

  * Add a method to calculate total and average marks.
  * Add another method to check grade (A/B/C).

* Implement inheritance:

  * A `Vehicle` base class with attributes like `brand`, `year`.
  * Subclasses `Car` and `Bike` that add specific attributes (`doors`, `engine_cc`).
  * Override `__str__` method to display details.

---

### **Hard**

* Create an abstract class `Shape` with an abstract method `area()`.

  * Implement `Circle`, `Square`, and `Triangle` classes that inherit from it.
  * Store a list of shapes and calculate the sum of all areas.

* Design a small `Library Management System`:

  * Classes: `Book`, `Member`, `Library`.
  * Features: Add book, borrow book, return book, list available books.
  * Use OOP concepts: encapsulation, composition, and maybe class methods for tracking.
