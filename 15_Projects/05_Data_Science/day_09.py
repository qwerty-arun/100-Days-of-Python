ðŸ“š **Problem Statement: Book Recommendation System**

1. **Objective:**
   To build a **content-based recommendation system** that suggests books similar to a given title based on their descriptions.

2. **Dataset:**
   The dataset (`books.csv`) contains details about books such as their **title**, **author**, and **description**.

3. **Approach:**

   * Use **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert book descriptions into numerical feature vectors.
   * Compute **Cosine Similarity** to measure how similar each book is to others based on description content.

4. **Implementation:**

   * When a book title is provided, the system retrieves the **top 5 most similar books** using cosine similarity scores.
   * The output displays the **titles and authors** of the recommended books.

5. **Expected Outcome:**
   The program recommends books with **similar themes or content**, helping users discover new books aligned with their interests.
